## Interactivity and Games

So far we have taken an expansive view within the context of programming for visual artists. We have studied a history of computers and programming, historical precedents of fluxus, instructions art and algorithmic art. We have looked at example works by contemporary artists creating interactive works and artworks made for the web. 

Now we are going to expand our context and consider video games within this context, and we will contrast it to other media and approaches.

Famously, Roger Ebert has stated clearly that [video games can never be art](https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art). Where are his thoughts correct? Where do they miss the mark?

Why then consider games within the context of this course Programming For Visual Arts?

Much like film and theater, games are a form that encompass a range of elements that come together to create a complete work of art. These include acting/dialogue, narrative, sound design, visual design, conceptual thinking and technical skills.

Games encompass these elements and also adds in interactivity. The choices presented in video games can be meaningful or overly simplistic. Games as a genre is quite wide - including simple puzzle challenges like Tetris or Flappy Bird to extensive 3d meta-narratives like opera in games like Kentucky Route Zero or Journey.

Today we will start small and modestly, building out a game, keeping in mind aesthetic, technical and conceptual modes of thinking.

Read: [We asked a computational poet if machines will ever replace human writers](https://thenextweb.com/tnw-answers/2020/04/01/we-asked-a-computational-poet-if-machines-will-ever-replace-human-writers/) - on Nick Montfort, founder of Taper

Method:

"Read" or view the selections from Taper above. Read about Taper. Read the article about Nick Montfort, founder of Taper. Are there particular pieces you like? Think about how some of these are made. If you are completely uncertain, look at *everything gets eaten* linked above. That one you should definitely be able to figure out an idea of how the code works. 

After reading (playing?) all of the above computational works, now design an experimental computational poem-artwork. 

- What is the title?
- What is the concept?
- You may want to plan with a sketch on paper first

Turn in:
- Title
- Short description (up to 1 paragraph)
- Link to piece working fullscreen
- Link to code


## Homework: Complete frogger

### REQUIRED
* add sound (replace/change my sound, add your own, add additional sounds - like a hop?)
* some cars going other direction
* show lives and score on screen.
* add images (background scenery? change the cars? maybe the frog has a tongue?)

### OPTIONAL
* start with 3 lives. after 3 collisions, game ends
* when dead, indicate game is over
* make the game 2 player. one player uses WASD. The other uses Arrow keys. it’s a race to get across 10 times.


* other kinds of obstacles (rocks? trains? something else?)
* power up?
* each time you get across the road, the game should get harder (and the frog starts over at the bottom)
* improve my collision detection. It’s not great now. Can you make it better?
* what are other ways to play with the challenge? maybe the cars increase as you cross the road succesfully
* countdown timer for the game? special apples for the frog to collect?&nbsp;
* the game could use a good background soundtrack
* anything else to make the game special and more unique
